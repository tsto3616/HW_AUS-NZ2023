# HW_AUS-NZ2023
Nemabiome/ BZ resistance of hookworms from NZ and Aus from the start of 2023. Samples Aus1-6 and NZ1-4

Analysed data in CLC main workbench. Applied a 0.05% cut off to the combined AU/NZ/VC data included in the spreadsheet. Species was then individually assigned in CLC main workbench through maximum likelihood phylogenies, comparing the ITS2 to the reference database that we trust. 

Using the 100% identity hookworm samples we trained the phylogenies to identify and classify species for the beta tubulin-1 region. All 3 reference files are in the master file list. No cut off was provided for the BZ assays due to the nature of the assays, which are detectign single copy genes.
