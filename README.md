# HW_AUS-NZ2023
Nemabiome/ BZ resistance of hookworms from NZ and Aus from the start of 2023. Samples Aus1-6 and NZ1-4

Present are the original files (HW_ITS2_merged.xlsx; 167table_transposed_withNos (version 1).xlsx; 200table_transposed_withNos.xlsx). 

Final_excel_hookworms_graph contains all the final data, albeit it contains mistakes for VC data and therefore must not be used. 

Note AU1= HOOK1, AU2=HOOK2, AU3=HOOK3, AU4=HOOK4, AU5=KELPIE, AU6=CAMDEN1

Note All SNPs except for 198 were susceptible genotypes, and thus are missing from the final data.
